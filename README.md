# Vibrance
My vibrance bash script to toggle colour vibrance on all active displays between default (0) and maximum (1023). Very useful for playing e.g. Counter-Strike on Linux with increased color vibrance when using proprietary nvidia graphics driver using nvidia-settings commands.

Depends on:
nvidia
nvidia-settings


If you want Steam to increase color vibrance for you with this script, start csgo and disable it again when you leave it,
move the script into the folder where your csgo files are installed,
enter "./vibrance; %command% && ./vibrance" as launch options on csgo in Steam.
